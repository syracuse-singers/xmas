# Formatting Directives

The `_carols.abh` format directives file can be placed in the global directory by using the `abcm2ps -V` command. For example, for the Homebrew install, it is:

```
Default format directory: /usr/local/Cellar/abcm2ps/8.14.7/share/abcm2ps
```

## Note

It appears that everytime Homebrew updates, the old location in the Cellar is deleted, so you have to copy `_carols.abh` over to it each time.
