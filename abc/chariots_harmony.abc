W:1. O Shepherd O shepherd come leave off your piping
W:Come listen come learn come hear what I say
W:For now is the time that has long been forespoken
W:For now is the time there'll be new tunes to play
W:For soon there comes one who brings a new music
W:Of sweetness and clarity none can compare
W:So open your heart for heavenly harmony
W:Here on this hill will be filling the air
W:
W:CHORUS
W:With chariots of cherubim chanting
W:And seraphim singing hosanna
W:And a choir of archangels a-caroling come
W:Hallelujah Hallelu
W:All the angels a-trumpeting glory
W:In praise of the Prince of Peace
W:
W:2. See on yon stable the starlight is shimmering
W:And glimmering and glistening and glowing with glee
W:In Bethlehem blest this baby of bliss will be
W:Born here before you as bold as can be
W:And you'll be the first to hear the new symphony
W:Songs full of gladness  and glory and light
W:So learn your tunes well and play your pipes proudly
W:For the Prince of Paradise plays here tonight
W:
W:3. Bring your sheep bleating to this happy meeting
W:To hear how the lamb with the lion shall lie
W:It's mooing and braying you'll hear the song saying
W:The humble and lowly will be the most high
W:Let the horn of the herdsman be heard up in heaven
W:For the gates are flung open for all who come near
W:And the simplest of souls shall sing to infinity
W:Lift up and listen and you shall hear
W:
W:4. The warmonger's charger will thunder for freedom
W:The gun-maker's furnace will dwindle and die
W:And muskets and sabers and swords shall be sundered
W:Surrendered to the sound that is sweeping the sky
W:And the shoes of the mighty shall dance to new measures
W:And the jackboots of generals shall jangle no more
W:As sister and brother and father and mother
W:Agree with each other the end to all war
W:
W:5. As a candle can conquer the demons of darkness
W:As a flame can keep frost from the deepest of cold
W:So a song can give hope in the depths of all danger
W:And a line of pure melody soar in your soul
W:So sing your songs well and sing your songs sweetly
W:And swear that your singing it never shall cease
W:So the clatter of battle and drums of disaster
W:Be drowned in the sound of the pipes of peace
