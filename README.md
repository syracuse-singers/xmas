# Christmas Carols

A group of singers in Syracuse, NY have been singing carols over the holidays for over 20 years. This site exists mostly as a way to share our favorite songs with each other. Keys and settings represent the preferences of the Syracuse group. Songs may be set for unison singing or parts depending on our preference and/or the availability of good arrangements. 

These are not the carols you generally hear on the radio or in shopping malls. We largely draw on English pub carols alon with a few modern carols that sound tradtional thrown in. You'll quickly figure out that not all of these are strictly speaking Christmas carols, but also include winter songs, wassails, wren songs (December 26), and even carols for the Feast Day of the Ass (January 14).

## Information About This Collection

The songs in this archive are written in [abc music notation](http://abcnotation.com/) and then converted to staff notation as a PDF file using Jef Moine's [abcm2ps](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/abcm2ps) music program. 

Caveat: Each year, as we meet to practice, we make additions, corrections, key changes, and occasionally whimsical alterations to a song's setting. In addition, new carols may be uploaded to the website before a final setting is approved by the group. The result is that some of the carols end up in a state of flux as we work on them. We actually find this situation to be slightly maddening, especially when we find ourselves working from different versions of the same carol because not everybody keeps their tunebook up to date. To further confuse things, the caroling group also may drop songs from its repertoire. When this happens, we remove it from the index of titles on the website and from the songbook, but we generally don't remove it from the repository.

To help mitigate this, individual tunes have a date and timestamp in the footer as a way to reference the current canonical version. You can track changes (beginning in 2017) in the repository's [issues](https://github.com/syracuse-singers/xmas/issues) page or via the repository's [commit history](https://github.com/syracuse-singers/xmas/commits/master). We also maintain a kanban style [project board](https://github.com/syracuse-singers/xmas/projects/1) where you can follow the progress on songs we're working on or considering.

## Copyright

We are using a [Creative Commons CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) license, which means, in this case, that we allow the songs to be used and remixed as long as there is an attribution back to where you got the arrangement. Most of these songs are public domain, but there may be a few songs that are still under copyright. If you are the copyright holder, create an issue and let us know.

## Downloading Files

For 2020, our intention had been to provide a single large songbook of the carols are in our active repertoire. A final version would have been labelled "Caroling 2020" instead of bearing a timestamp. The hope had been to print out new pages for the entire group to, literally, get us all on the same page. All of those plans got blown out of the water because of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, we've been continuing to add new tunes to the website, but vetting them will have to wait until 2021.
