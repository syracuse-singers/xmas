# Christmas Carols

A group of singers in Syracuse, NY have been singing carols over the holidays for over 20 years. This site exists mostly as a way to share our favorite songs with each other. Keys and settings represent the preferences of the Syracuse group. Songs may be set for unison singing or parts depending on our preference and/or the availability of good arrangements. 

These are not the carols you generally hear on the radio or in shopping malls. We largely draw on English pub carols but also include a few newer carols that have a traditional feel. You'll quickly figure out that not all of these are strictly speaking Christmas carols, but also include winter songs, wassails, wren songs (December 26), and even carols for the Feast Day of the Ass (January 14).

## Downloading Files

For 2021, we ask members of the group to print out a new songbook using the file below to, literally, get us all on the same page. We'll use this timestamped version for now, mainly because several of the tunes marked "NEW" have not been vetted or corrected yet. 

We're offering two versions of the songbook at the moment. The print version includes a [table of contents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-5Jqz2rdc5soY4zLDcV7AOISRcnfWTUR-uOklLoB7U/edit?usp=sharing) and the occasional extra blank page to allow multi-page songs to layout nicely when you print double-sided. The tablet version includes bookmarks in the PDF, arranged in song title order, to help with navigation.

See the [master carol repository](https://github.com/syracuse-singers/xmas) for the complete list of song files. Via the repository, can download the abc song masters individually or [download the entire repository in one largish zip file](https://github.com/syracuse-singers/xmas/archive/master.zip). You can find [past versions of tunes](https://github.com/syracuse-singers/xmas/releases). The repository includes songs we have dropped from our repertoire and which are no longer indexed on the webpage.

## Information About This Collection

The songs in this archive are written in [abc music notation](http://abcnotation.com/) and then converted to staff notation, first as a PostScript file using Jef Moine's [abcm2ps](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/abcm2ps) music program and then, using the MacOS Preview program, to PDF format.

Each year, as we meet to practice, we make additions, corrections, key changes, and other alterations to a song's setting. In addition, new carols &ndash; marked by the <img src="img/new.svg" alt="New"> icon &ndash; may be uploaded to the website before a final setting is approved by the group. The result is that some of the carols end up in a state of flux as we work on them. We actually find this situation to be slightly maddening, especially when we find ourselves working from different versions of the same carol because not everybody keeps their songbook up to date. 

To help mitigate this, individual tunes have a date and timestamp in the footer as a way to reference the most recent version. You can track changes (beginning in 2017) in the repository's [issues](https://github.com/syracuse-singers/xmas/issues) page or via the repository's [commit history](https://github.com/syracuse-singers/xmas/commits/master). We also maintain a kanban style [project board](https://github.com/syracuse-singers/xmas/projects/1) where you can follow the progress on songs we're working on or considering.
